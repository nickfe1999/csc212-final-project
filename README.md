This project is a hospital with the room numbers representing the coordinates lays on a 2d grid. The program create patient objects that have room number assigned to them as well as a blood type based on the input file supplied. The program also asks the user what type of blood is needed to the Emergency Room, the origin coordinate, and create a KD Tree inserting only the patients with the same blood type. After inserting, the program runs the Nearest Neighbor algorithm to find and output the patient with the closest coordinates to the origin, which is our hypothetical emergency room.

In order to install and run the project, one must have all files in the repo. The program visually executes in the terminal with prompts that you follow. You can add patients manually or use a .txt file in the correct format replicating the Patients.txt. Once the first prompt is shown, user must type either 'f' for find closest patient to ER or 'r' to register a new patient.
